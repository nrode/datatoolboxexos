# datatoolboxexos

This repository contains the data and code I used during the CESAB
workshop.

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Authors, (2020). *Compendium of R code and data for Data and code for
> the CESAB datatoolbox exercises*. Accessed 03 nov 2020. Online at
> <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx> \#\# Contents

The [**exercise**](exercise/) directory contains:

  - [::spiral\_notepad:: exo\_dplyr](/exercise/exo_dplyr.Rmd)

R Markdown source documents for the exercise. Includes code to reproduce
the figures and tables generated by the analyses. They also have
rendered versions, `.md` and `html` suitable respectively for reading on
github and in a web browser.

The [**data**](data/) directory contains the Data used in the analysis.
There is a `README` in that directory that describes the Data.

## How to run it ?

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from this URL:
[main.zip](https://github.com/nrode/datatoolboxexos/archive/main.zip).
After unzipping:

  - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio

  - open `make.R` and source it to ensure you have the packages this
    analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION)
    file) and produce the reports for all the exercercices.
